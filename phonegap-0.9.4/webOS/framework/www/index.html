<!-- You can omit the HTML header and the body tag since it is defined
in root.html. In fact, this is the way it works on webOS and its scenes. -->
<div id="jqt">
  <div id="home" class="current">

    <h2>PhoneGap Template</h2>
    
    <div class="content">
      <p>This template is a basic example of an PhoneGap App on webOS using
      the jQTouch Framework. It can easily be modified, extended, and used
      with another Framework (e.g. jQuery Mobile).</p>
      
      <a href="#" class="bigButton" id="takePicture">Camera.getPicture() example</a>
      
      <p>Because this is a Scene from webOS's point of view,
      scolling actually works. To let you test this, this text has been
      made extra long and boring. But nothing is to much to bring pleasure
      to you, dear user.</p>
      
      <p>So, hopefully this example can help you to get started on your
      mobile building quest! Have fun with this, and create many exciting
      Apps to make this beautiful platform really shine!</p>
